            <h3>Iota uses <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a></h3>
            <p>
            FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
            UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11), Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK
            provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
            graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

            <h3>Iota uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a></h3>
            <p>
            OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive
            2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL
            has become the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D
            graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of
            applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters
            innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad
            set of rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful
            visualization functions. Developers can leverage the power of OpenGL
            across all popular desktop and workstation platforms, ensuring wide
            application deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
            End users, independent software vendors, and others writing code based
            on the OpenGL API are free from licensing requirements.
