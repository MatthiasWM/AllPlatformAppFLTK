        <p>
        FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
        UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11), Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK
        provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
        graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

        <h3>Iota uses <a href="https://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a></h3>
        <p>
        OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive
        2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL
        has become the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D
        graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of
        applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters
        innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad
        set of rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful
        visualization functions. Developers can leverage the power of OpenGL
        across all popular desktop and workstation platforms, ensuring wide
        application deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
        End users, independent software vendors, and others writing code based
        on the OpenGL API are free from licensing requirements.
